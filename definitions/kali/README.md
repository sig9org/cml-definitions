# Kali Linux

I deployed the image and converted the Raw format to Qcow2. However, when booted on CML, it repeatedly displayed the GRUB menu and I couldn't do anything. I tried the following image:

- [kali-linux-2025.4-cloud-genericcloud-amd64.tar.xz](https://kali.download/cloud-images/kali-2025.4/kali-linux-2025.4-cloud-genericcloud-amd64.tar.xz)
